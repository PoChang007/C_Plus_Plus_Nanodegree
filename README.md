# Udacity - C++ Nanodegree Program

The summary of my learnings in Udacity's CPPND program.  
The program first walks you through Object-Oriented Programming concepts and then gets you exposed to Modern C++ features.

## Installation

Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/PoChang007/C_Plus_Plus_Nanodegree.git`

## Build Instructions

See the build instructions in each project folder.

## [Project 1 - Route Planning](https://github.com/PoChang007/C_Plus_Plus_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project_1_Route_Planning)

In this project, we create a route planner between two points on real map data. The optimal path between the starting point and the ending point can be found by implementing A* search algorithm.

## [Project 2 - System Monitor](https://github.com/PoChang007/C_Plus_Plus_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project_2_System_Monitor)

In this project, we build a system monitor that resemble the program [htop](https://htop.dev/), which is a standard program for monitoring Linux systems.

## [Project 3 - Memory Management Chatbot](https://github.com/PoChang007/C_Plus_Plus_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project_3_Memory_Management_Chatbot)

In this project, we optimize a Chatbot program with modern c++ memory management method (e.g. smart pointer, move semantics).

## [Project 4 - Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation](https://github.com/PoChang007/C_Plus_Plus_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project_4_Program_a_Concurrent_Traffic_Simulation)

In this project, we build a multithreaded traffic simulator (vehicles, streets, intersections and traffic lights) using a real urban map. Each vehicle is run on a separate thread. And intersections are managed to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.
